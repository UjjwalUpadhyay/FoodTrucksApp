The app uses React and Bootstrap for creating the user interface and Webpack to build the application.     
The datasource comes directly from [Data SF](https://data.sfgov.org/Permitting/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat). 

The application's screen is divided in half, with the map instance on the left side and filters/trucks list on the right.
